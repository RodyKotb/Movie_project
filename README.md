# Project Details
you will conduct your own data analysis and create a file to share that documents your findings. You should start by taking a look at your dataset and brainstorming what questions you could answer using it. Then you should use pandas and NumPy to answer the questions you are most interested in, and create a report sharing the answers. You will not be required to use inferential statistics or machine learning to complete this project, but you should make it clear in your communications that your findings are tentative. This project is open-ended in that we are not looking for one right answer.
Movie Data Set
Data Set: TMDb Movie Data(opens in a new tab). This data is cleaned from the original TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset(opens in a new tab) on Kaggle.com.

Overview and Notes This data set contains information about movies, including user ratings and revenue.

Certain columns, like ‘cast’ and ‘genres’, contain multiple values separated by pipe (|) characters.
There are some odd characters in the ‘cast’ column. Don’t worry about cleaning them. You can leave them as is.
The final two columns ending with _adj show the budget and revenue of the associated movie in terms of 2010 dollars, accounting for inflation over time.
Example Questions

Which genres are most popular from year to year?
What kinds of properties are associated with movies that have high revenues?


# Get Organized
Eventually you’ll want to submit your project (and share it with friends, family, and employers). Get organized before you begin. We recommend creating a single folder that will eventually contain:

The report communicating your findings
Any Python code you wrote as part of your analysis
The data set you used (which you will not need to submit)
You may wish to use a Jupyter notebook, in which case you can submit both the code you wrote and the report of your findings in the same document. Otherwise, you will need to submit your report and code separately. If you would like a notebook template to help organize your investigation, you can click here(opens in a new tab). Or there may be a page in the project here called Project Workspace: Complete and Submit Project, where you can do all your work and submit the project.


# Analyze Your Data
Brainstorm some questions you could answer using the data set you chose, then start answering those questions. You can find some questions in the data set options(opens in a new tab) to help you get started.

Try and suggest questions that promote looking at relationships between multiple variables. You should aim to analyze at least one dependent variable and three independent variables in your investigation. Make sure you use NumPy and pandas where they are appropriate!
